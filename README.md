A Rust implementation of the game systems from [TheFarmerWasReplaced](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The_Farmer_Was_Replaced/). This project aims to replicate the game's mechanics and provide a library for developing and testing algorithms more efficiently.

## About

TheFarmerWasReplaced is a programming puzzle game where you automate a farm using code. This project recreates its core systems to enable algorithm development, testing, and experimentation outside the game environment.
